# While running the graders in production, Coursera passes several command line arguments to the ENTRYPOINT command
# in no particular order. For local testing, the below commands can be used in place of the above ENTRYPOINT command 
# to simulate passing command line arguments to executeGrader.sh.
# More details about these Coursera supplied command line parameters can be found in executeGrader.sh.

# Command to simulate Factoring Grader:
# ENTRYPOINT ["./grader/executeGrader.sh", "partId", "HxbKF"]
# Command to simulate Prime Grader:
# ENTRYPOINT ["./grader/executeGrader.sh", "partId", "ov8KA"]
