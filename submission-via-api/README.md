Instructors may want to use our submission API directly within their assignment rather than having learners upload their solution files via our web UI.

This use case might particularly be useful for instructors who want to integrate the submission workflow with the development environment itself for faster edit-submit cycles. This requires instructors to hook up Coursera's submission API inside the development environment they deliver to the learners.
